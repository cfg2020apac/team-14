## About Our Project
### The Issue
Junior Achievement HK has manually orchestrated the involvement of over 380,000 students and 25,000 volunteers for years. Program reminders are made by phone calls. Registrations are handled via Google Docs. Communication is iffy and data is hard to analyze. With more students possessing ambitious entrepreneurial and career goals, the numbers will only increase. We help solve this administrative nightmare.

### Our Magic Solution
Our solution features mass email communication with a click. We eliminate the need for phone calls by sending automated program reminders to students. Painstaking manual data collation is alleviated by registration pages which update a data visualization dashboard to track program status. Establishing two-way communication with student and volunteer feedback forms, sharing of ideas is facilitated.
